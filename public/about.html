<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! My name is Raiyan, an international student from Bangladesh currently pursuing a Computer Science major at Memorial University of Newfoundland.
  My journey to Canada has been an exciting adventure, filled with new experiences and opportunities to grow. As I navigate through my undergraduate studies,
  I balance my academic pursuits with my part-time job as a customer service associate at Walmart and my passion projectâ€”St. John's Auto Detailer,
  where I bring cars back to their pristine glory with meticulous detailing skills.

<p>
  I'm an avid Dungeons & Dragons enthusiast, enjoying both playing and crafting intricate campaigns that immerse my friends in fantastical worlds.
  My love for storytelling extends to my favorite TV shows like 'Game of Thrones,' 'House of Dragons,' and 'The Last of Us,' as well as my cherished books,
  'A Song of Ice and Fire' and 'Pathogens.' I also enjoy unwinding with epic movies like 'Spirited Away' and 'Jphn Wick'
</p>
<p>
  When I'm not busy with my studies or detailing cars, you'll find me playing video games, exploring new technology, or diving into the latest social media trends.
  I also love traveling, sightseeing, and engaging in meaningful discussions with like-minded individuals.
</p>
<p>
My goal is to make a positive impact in my community, particularly in the fields of financial economics, education, and healthcare.
I enjoy being a part of the vibrant community here in Canada and am always eager to share my cultural insights and personal experiences.
Whether it's discussing the challenges and triumphs of transitioning to a new country or sharing tips on car detailing,
I'm here for friendly and informative conversations.
